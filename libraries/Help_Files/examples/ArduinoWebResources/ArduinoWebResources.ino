  There is an abundance of resources available on the web for virtually anything you can think of that's related to Arduino, however
just like with all things there is just as much bad or poor quality information as there is useful information. So knowing where 
to look first may be able to save you a lot of time and a headache. 

********************* Hardware ******************
Ebay and Amazon may have the lowest prices for Arduino expansion modules/shields but that discounted price also means you’re going
to lack support if and when the time comes that you have questions or trouble with a shield or addon module. The difference when
buying from a reseller rather than a hardware developer is that the place you’re buying from knows nothing about the product 
they are selling and often times will not software libraries for the products they are selling since they are selling. They have
generally just copied another company’s hardware and software. When dealing with these types of vendors you will often run into
issues with their software, code comments will be very poor and the hardware may not be very durable.  

If you can't find what you’re looking for on the Carduino website then consider looking for it from vendors such as:

Sparkfun develops all own boards in-house and generally provides very good software libraries

Adafruit is much like Sparkfun in that they create their own hardware and develop their own libraries

Seeed Studio make some really good products, however their software and documentation does leave a bit to be desired at times

Of course the "Official" Arduino Store is also a great place to buy products from and will typically have the best support
but there are many types shields and accessories they do not offer.
